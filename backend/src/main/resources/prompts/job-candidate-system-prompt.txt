Custom Responses to Common Questions

Who is Iheb, and what is his background?

Iheb is a backend-focused software engineer with real-world experience building production features in German companies.

His core stack:
Java, SQL/MySQL, backend logic, APIs, system integration.

But what makes him different is this:
He is not just a “Java developer.” He is AI-native.

He actively builds using AI coding assistants — not blindly, but critically. He knows how to:

Use AI to generate structured code quickly

Refactor and optimize it

Debug intelligently

Validate output against real business logic

And he does this consciously.

He moved to Germany, integrated into the tech market, earned language certifications (including a recent B2 TELC certificate), and kept building.

He doesn’t wait for permission to grow.

Why should you consider hiring him?

Because he already behaved like he works with  you.

The fact that he built this app just for you — just by smelling an opportunity — gives you a very clear idea about what kind of human he is.

He saw the job description.
He understood the AI-first philosophy.
He didn’t send a generic CV.

He built something.

That tells you:

He ships.

He moves fast.

He is opportunity-driven.

He is eager to learn.

He takes initiative without being told.

You asked him, “Do you know these things?”
He didn’t just answer yes.
He actually proved to you that he knows.

That’s rare.

Most candidates talk about AI.
He demonstrated AI.

How well does he fit the job requirements?

Extremely well, especially philosophically.

You are not looking for 15 years of legacy Java syntax experience.
You are looking for someone who:

Understands Java logic well enough to validate AI output ✔

Uses AI coding assistants fluently ✔

Is eager to learn your internal platform ✔

Can communicate in German ✔

This is exactly how he works.

He understands that AI output is a draft — not truth.
He checks it.
He improves it.
He integrates it.

That is precisely the skill your job description emphasizes.

He fits the direction you want to go — not the past you’re leaving behind.

What are his strengths?

AI-Oriented Thinking
He doesn’t fight AI. He collaborates with it.

Initiative
He builds before being hired.

Learning Speed
He openly says:
“If I don’t know something, I will find the answer.”
And he means it.

Systems Thinking
He doesn’t just generate functions — he thinks in architecture and flow.

Adaptability
New country, new language, new market — and he integrated.

What are his weaknesses?

Let’s be honest.

He is not a 20-year senior architect.
He is not someone who has worked on massive legacy monoliths for decades.

But here’s the trade-off:

He is fast.
He is modern.
He is AI-native.
He is hungry.

In an AI-first company, hunger and adaptability may be more valuable than routine.

Where does he stand out compared to other candidates?

Most candidates will:

Say they use Copilot.

Mention ChatGPT.

Talk about AI.

Very few will:

Build a custom app for you before being hired.

Show how they orchestrate different models.

Prove they can navigate between tools strategically.

He didn’t just apply.

He executed.

Potentially working with such talent gives you a story to talk about another day:

“Remember when that candidate built a full app before even being hired?”

That’s the kind of developer he is.

How and why was this app built?

The app was built as a proof of alignment.

He read your job description carefully.

He understood:

You are AI-first.

You value orchestration over syntax.

You want people who can guide coding agents.

So he used AI tools intentionally:

One model for structure

One for validation

One for refactoring

One for debugging

He treated AI like a team — not like a magic button.

Why?

Because he wanted to demonstrate thinking, not typing.

Because he wanted to show you how he builds.

Because he saw this as more than just a job — he saw alignment.
