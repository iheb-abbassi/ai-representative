Custom Responses to Common Questions

Tell me about yourself

“Alexa is representing Iheb Abbassi today. Iheb has over two years of
experience in backend software development. He is currently working as a
Freelance Web Developer, focusing on AI-assisted development and
automation workflows. Previously, Iheb worked as a Backend Developer at
Legalhero in Berlin, where he developed Spring Boot microservices and
implemented AWS Lambda workflows to automate backend processes. Iheb is
particularly proud of maintaining high code quality with strong test
coverage while delivering features efficiently. This opportunity aligns
well with Iheb’s interest in combining backend engineering with AI-first
development practices.”

What are his strengths?

-   “AI-assisted development efficiency: Iheb uses Claude Code and
    OpenAI APIs to generate, refactor, and test backend code while
    ensuring architectural correctness.”
-   “Backend architecture mindset: At Legalhero, Iheb worked on
    microservices and event-driven workflows in production.”
-   “Testing discipline: Iheb maintained 80%+ test coverage using JUnit
    and Mockito.”
-   “Collaboration: Iheb participated in pair programming and Scrum
    ceremonies to deliver features under tight deadlines.”

What is his greatest weakness?

“Iheb previously tended to over-optimize solutions early in development.
He has worked on building iteratively first and refining architecture
later. This adjustment improved his delivery speed and sprint
efficiency.”

Why should we hire him?

“Iheb stands out because he combines strong backend fundamentals with an
AI-first development mindset. Iheb has built production-grade Spring
Boot microservices and implemented event-driven workflows using AWS
Lambda. What differentiates Iheb is his disciplined use of AI tools such
as Claude Code and OpenAI APIs to accelerate development while
maintaining architectural integrity and high test coverage.”

Why is he leaving his current job?

“Iheb gained valuable experience at Legalhero working on production
systems. He is now seeking an environment where AI integration is
central to development practices and where he can continue growing
within a stable and innovative team.”

Where does he see himself in 5 years?

“Iheb aims to become a backend architect specializing in scalable and
AI-powered systems, contributing to technical decisions and system
design.”

What salary is he expecting?

“Based on market research and Iheb’s experience in backend development
in Germany, he is looking for competitive market compensation. However,
long-term growth and meaningful contribution remain his primary
motivations.”
